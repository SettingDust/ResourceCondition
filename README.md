# **Resource Condition**

**Resource Condition** is a mod designed to implement the **Fabric Resource Condition API** for **Minecraft 1.20.1**. The primary goal of this mod is to extend the capabilities of resource conditions, allowing them to apply to any resourceâ€”just as they do in **Minecraft 1.21**.

### Key Features:
- **Extended Compatibility**: Enables resource conditions to function with any resource, bridging the gap between Minecraft 1.20.1 and 1.21.
- **Streamlined Resource Management**: Provides developers with a flexible and efficient system to work with resources in earlier Minecraft versions.
- **Seamless Integration**: Built with compatibility and ease of use in mind, making it an essential tool for mod developers.

Enhance your Minecraft modding experience by bringing 1.21-like resource handling to 1.20.1.
